  watch.ps1 - auto-reapply the claude-rtl patch after a Claude (Squirrel) update. (P7.3)

  Squirrel updates Claude by creating a NEW app-<ver> folder under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude
  and pointing the launcher at it; that fresh folder has none of our patch, so RTL vanishes until
  it is re-applied. This watcher (the launchd watch.sh analogue, docs/WINDOWS.md sec 7) detects the
  new / unpatched install, waits for the update to SETTLE, then runs patch.ps1.

  SAFE TO LEAVE RUNNING: the "is it patched?" test is a READ-ONLY marker scan of app.asar, so the
  watcher NEVER stops Claude when the install is already patched - no thrashing on every logon.

  Hosted by a per-user logon entry (install with: patch.ps1 -Watch). Resident + event-driven:
  a FileSystemWatcher wakes it promptly when a new app-* folder appears; a periodic re-check
  (every -PollSeconds) is the backstop in case an event is missed.

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File watch.ps1           # resident (logon)
    powershell ... -File watch.ps1 -Once      # one settle+patch-if-needed cycle, then exit
    powershell ... -File watch.ps1 -DryRun    # detect + log "would patch", never patches

  ASCII-only (the diagnose.ps1 lesson).
